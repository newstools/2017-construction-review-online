The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is the world s largest technical professional society. Founded in 1884 by a handful of practitioners of the new electrical engineering discipline.The men and women of the IEEE are the technical and scientific professionals making the revolutionary engineering advances which are reshaping our world.The technical objectives of the IEEE focus on advancing the theory and practice of electrical, electronics and computer engineering and computer science.To realize these objectives, the IEEE sponsors technical conferences, symposia and local meetings worldwide: publishes nearly 25% of the worlds technical papers in electrical, electronics and computer engineering; provides educational programs to keep its members knowledge and expertise state-of-the-art.When you join IEEE, you join a community of over 425,000 technology and engineering professionals united by a common desire to continuously learn, interact, collaborate, and innovate.IEEE membership provides you with the resources and opportunities you need to keep on top of changes in technology; get involved in standards development; network with other professionals in your local area or within a specific technical interest; mentor the next generation of engineers and technologists, and so much more.There is no better time to discover all that IEEE membership has to offer.NEW applications received between 1 March and 15 August will automatically be processed for half-year membership ending 31 December at the half-year dues rates. Exception is when the applicant specifically requests their application be processed for the full year.
