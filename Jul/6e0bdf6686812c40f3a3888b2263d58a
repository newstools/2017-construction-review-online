Since its foundation in Cape Town in 2013, SOLA Future Energy has now an officially established Johannesburg branch to service clients in the Gauteng region, as well as neighboring African countries.In Gauteng, SOLA Future Energy has already carried out several projects, including Growthpoint s Key West Mall, Sasol s Cradlestone Mall, Goldfields Head Office, and three systems for Netcare Hospitals.In addition, the company has recently secured agreements with Atterbury Property Group and Ekurhuleni Municipality, which both promise several more MW capacity of projects in the pipeline. SOLA has designed, constructed and continues to maintain a diverse portfolio of projects and having a base in Johannesburg will help to expand that. African businesses are realising that putting solar on their roofs makes good business sense, said Jonathan Skeen, GM of SOLA Future Energy Johannesburg.Since opening its doors in Cape Town in 2013, SOLA Future Energy has been responsible for the design, construction and monitoring of 25 large rooftop PV systems, resulting in over 11 MW of installed capacity across South Africa.Included in this portfolio is Redefine s Black River Park, one of the first buildings in Cape Town to successfully sell electricity back on to the municipal grid and Robben Island, a fully self-sufficient hybrid PV battery project.At the launch of their Johannesburg office, SOLA focused on the latest trends in solar technology and its application in a business context. Just a few years ago, the adoption of solar was rare and even unappealing to business. In the past few years, we ve seen an exponential growth in the interest, and adoption, of solar systems as the business case becomes clearer. We now need business to believe in the value of distributed energy versus grid systems, said Dom Wills, CEO of SOLA Future Energy.The Johannesburg office of SOLA Future Energy is based at Commerce Square, 39 Rivonia Road.
