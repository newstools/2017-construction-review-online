Furthermore, the continued low rainfall levels resulted in dry conditions causing widespread drought in all nine provinces.This led to 8 of them- Gauteng excluded- being declared states of drought disaster.The department is also engaged with relevant shareholders as far as the drought situation is concerned as part of its continued efforts to help distressed farmers in order to find solutions to moderate the drought.They are also sourcing funds from National Treasury through the National Disaster management Centre (NDMC) in the department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs for drought assistance.This was after verification of drought in the declared areas. Consequently, the National Treasury set aside $16.32m available for the financial year 2016/2017 for assisting farmers across the country.Provinces have also made a contribution to that effect by setting aside $15.05m to be made available to affected farmers through equitable share funding.The funds were utilized to assist affected farmers. The Prevention and Mitigation of Disaster Risk (PMDR) program expended funds as well as intervening in the borehole drilling and construction of fire breaks.In the meantime however, water restrictions continue despite the onset of heavy rains falling across the country. This is said to continue until the Department of Water and Sanitation are satisfied that the water is enough in all the catchment areas.The farmers are also taking the rain as a good sign. On the other hand, the Agriculture South Africa Chairperson says that more than rain is needed in some areas.
