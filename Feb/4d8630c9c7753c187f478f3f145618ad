Swiss-based clean energy provider The Meeco Group has installed the largest solar power plant in ZimbabweMany companies in Africa are struggling with electricity shortage, power cuts and the dependency on diesel generators.Also read:Eltek to install 104 solar arrays in Zimbabwe s hospitalsThe present installation of the so far biggest solar power plant in Zimbabwe, with a whole capacity of 216 kWp, marks a key turning point in the history of energy supply in Zimbabwe and its companies, which are still strongly reliant on fossil fuels.The Swiss-based clean energy provider the Meeco Group outfitted the facility of a Zimbabwean company with its eco-friendly solar power solution sun2live.The sun2live energy generating system is an environmental friendly renewable energy solution. To meet the local requirements of the consumer, Meeco has extremely tailored this energy solution.A special static tracker facilitates the most competent positioning of the solar modules, which are oriented to two different directions in order to make sure the maximum and over the day optimized energy production.Furthermore, Meeco has placed the ground-mounted photovoltaic system at two different sites. The first 152 kWp sun2live solution will be installed near a lake, from where the facility obtains the water for its production process.The sun2live system will create the energy to run the pumps to process the water. Another 64 KWp sun2live solar power solution will be raised at the company s facility itself and will cut off the diesel consumption as up until now the complete energy demand is being covered entirely by diesel generators.This PV system will lead to an annual reduction of roughly 134,000 liters of diesel and will in addition save 280 tons of CO2 emission for every year.Meeco will provide its sun2live solar energy system according to the turnkey project execution model. As a result, meeco has designed this highly customized and individual solar energy project and installed it in order to convey the concluded installation to their client.
