International collaboration and knowledge sharing the key to the growth of Latin America s energy sector? We ll find out at the Growing Economies: Latin America Energy Forum this March Different countries should collaborate in three areas: the development of human capital, capable of solving the different problems predicted to face in the next years; providing open public information on energy to the community; and sharing good practices and knowledge for the construction of appropriate public policies in the energy sector. Andr s Romero Celed n, Executive Secretary,National Energy Commission of the Government of Chile interviewed prior to the Growing Economies: Latin America Energy Forum, the Executive Secretary of the National Energy Commission of the Government of Chile, Andres Romero Celedon, believes these three components are critical for the growth of the energy sector in Latin America and the challenges that it faces.Celed nwho previously led the process of building the Chilean energy efficiency policy and whose program was recognized internationally with the &#8220;Energy Efficiency Visionary Award-2010&#8243;(awarded by the Alliance to Save Energy, USA), will join the Regulators Roundtable Discussion at the Forum next month from 9-10 March in Washington DC,to brief investors on what strategies are in place to encourage inward investment into Chile.Chile alone has a long-term National Energy Policy called &#8220;Energy 2050. The main goal of this policy is to see at least 70% of national electricity generated from renewable energy, and to ensure that all energy projects developed in the country come from a partnership between the community and commercial companies.The current government has stated that the most immediate priorities in the energy sector will be to maintain the rhythm of investments (in 2016, energy was the leading sector in Chileaccounting for30% of total investment to the tune of US $ 5.8 billion); to introduce innovation in the sector; to finalize the Cardones-Pulpaico transmission line and the regional energy integration and to promote upcoming tenders for electricity supply.Other Ministers of Energy, Regulatorsand Heads of Utilities from Mexico, Argentina, Guatemala, Brazil and Peru will address Latin American countries latest strategies, policies and present opportunities for project partnerships in the energy sector, to further engage investors and stimulate open discussions.The Latin America Energy Forum will see over 250 energy developers, financiers and public sector stakeholdersgather from North and Latin America.Topics will include regulation development, investigating how regulator strategies are impacting investors confidence and behaviour, the Renewable Energy Transition , identifying the increasing need of adaptation to accommodate the growth of the renewables sector, and a panel on Renewable Energy Technology &#8211; exploring the potential of technology as the biggest enabler of renewable power production at more competitive costs.Other panel discussions will explore the impact of Distributed Generation in saving investments in transmission and improving the stability of the electric power service, a session on gas demand following the International Energy Agency s estimate that natural gas fired generation in Central and South America will increase by an average of 2.2 per cent a year, and a finance-focused session examining the role of development finance institutions and commercial finance providers in availing capital.The Latin America Energy Forum is co-located with the Powering Africa: Summit from 9-10 March at the Marriott Marquis Washington, D.C. The Powering Africa: Summit is a conference for decision-makers in the energy sector showcasing African energy &amp; infrastructure projects seeking investment.For more information about this meeting:Meeting dates: 9-10 March 2017Venue: Marriott Marquis, Washington, D.C., USAWebsite: www.latam-growingeconomies.comContact: Amy Offord Marketing ManagerEmail: Amy.offord@energynet.co.ukTelephone: +44 (0)20 7384 8068
