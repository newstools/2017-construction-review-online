South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (SAPVIA) welcomes the recognition of the success of the Renewable Energy IPP Procurement Programme (REIPPP) by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa at WEF 2016 in Davos and of the potential contribution that the private sector can play in bringing price and cost efficiencies into South Africa s electricity supply industry.We believe that the innovation shown by the RE sector is one that will assist in bringing tangible socio-economic benefits to South African residential, commercial and industrial users going forward.
