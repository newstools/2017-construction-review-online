Law makers are contemplating to support the government to borrow a loan of US$ 2.2 billion to enable road construction in Liberia.The Liberian lawmakers say they will be seeking to request the President to lobby with international financial institutions or friendly governments on the possibility of getting a US$2.2 billion loan on behalf of the country.This latest proposal comes in the wake of government&#8217;s inability to raise its budget of over US$600 million, with several shortfalls reported by the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning over the past years.According to the lawmakers led by Numene Bartekwa, he urged his colleagues to seek a concurrence from the Senate for the legislature to request the President lobby with international financial institutions or friendly governments on the possibility of getting a US$2.2 billion loan on behalf of the country.The expected resolution must be signed by two thirds of both Houses before it becomes legal framework for Sirleaf to make any borrowing moves. In his argument, Rep. Bartekwa ((UP-District #2 Grand Kru County) said considering that the country&#8217;s effective social delivery to the people of Liberia the government is indeed contingent on better or improved roads networks.He noted that developing the roads in the country will surely lead to national economic stimulation, adding that there&#8217;s a need for necessary action to be taken.&#8220;Accordingly and in consonance with Article 34 d(iii) which states that no loans shall be raised by the government on behalf of the Republic or guarantees given for any public institution or authority otherwise than by or under the authority of legislative enactment,&#8221; the lawmaker added.The plan to boost road MPs in Liberia comes at a time when the current president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is expected to leaf office after serving for two terms.&nbsp;
