These are: Consultancy providers who are inclusive of water auditors, planning engineers, accountants, lawyers.Among these are technology suppliers as well who supply hardware such as filters and treatment systems, pumps and piping, or help with the operation and maintenance services.The water service companies will be tasked with provision of water savings measured in comparison to a previous water cost.Engineering Procurement Contractors will be useful in providing the detailed engineering design for a project, procure all the necessary equipment and construct and deliver a functioning facility.During the research phase of the report, stakeholders in the water sector and other green economy sectors were consulted, and a range of business opportunities identified.Some of these include the following: Water reuse, recycling and resource recovery, Energy, Water management, Reducing water losses and Investment.The report revealed that about 37% of the country s potable water is lost through water leaks, and for some time now, reducing municipal water losses has become a national priority.However, when it comes to business opportunities here, the report suggests looking at barriers that stand in the way of new water technologies and practices such as lack of awareness about the importance and business benefits of water use efficiency and reuse, lack of adequate funding, slow pace in acting by the municipal councils among others. .
