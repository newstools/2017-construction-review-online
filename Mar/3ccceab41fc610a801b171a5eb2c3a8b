The African Union (AU) is making efforts to set up uniform standards among the African nations in the fields of electricity, electronics and associated technologies to guarantee fast and worldwide access to energy, a press report said.A continental electricity standard is in the works, Paul Johnson, executive secretary of African Electro technical Standardization Commission (Afsec) of the AU, told the press on Wednesday.Johnson said Afsec will make possible global access to energy across the continent and the accomplishment of Africa s Agenda 2063 a development framework that aspires to attain a continent that is incorporated, peaceful, affluent and people-centered. Homogeneous standards allow a nation to borrow machineries with uniform standards from neighboring states for use without difficulties, he said.Afsec presently has 13 members and it is trying to mobilize another 55 African nations to join the standardization.It has approved 140 standards which are applicable in the continent and are observing how these standards operate. Even though African nations function as self-governing states, we need competent and sustainable standards in technical matters.The standardization will allow the continent to realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that endeavor to achieve affordable access to clean energy, education and healthcare by 2030 for nation around the world. He said some African nations are not familiar with SDG standards and procedures, like what standards are essential when a nation plans to embark on rural electrification.Johnson suggested that African nation seeking better access to energy should avoid depending too much on old technology, and instead should use smart technology such as mini-grid, smart metres and renewable energy.Afsec is tasked with technical training on the set of standards, conferring with stakeholders, regulators and power utilities about the necessary standards and plans to find more technical committees and advance existing ones
