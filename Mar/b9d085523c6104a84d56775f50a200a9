The real estate sector has surprised many with its bright outlook despite the election set for August this year.Big players like Cytonn Investments, Knight Frank and Hass Consult remain optimistic about the sector sighting capital inflows as the reason behind new construction work henceforth.This is confirmed by Hass Consult s Research and marketing manager stating that long term investments such as those for real estate don t fluctuate around elections given the long term prospect as well as return projections.
