A recent gradual rise in the water levels in the Limpopo river has led to the closure of three border posts between South Africa and Botswana. Affected ports of entry are Pont Drif near Alldays, Platjan and Zanzibar outside Lephalale.Also read:Construction work on Limpopo water project resumesThe Pont Drift is next to the Mapungubwe World Heritage Site at the convergence of Limpopo and Shashe river that divide Botswana. Vehicle crossing at Pont Drift Border Post is highly dependent on the water level of the Limpopo.The only way across at Pontdrif in the case of extremely high water levels-such as is the case- would then be by a cable car that runs on a cable strung across the river. Over the past few days the swollen river has hindered the movement of tourists, who are forced to use cable cars to get around.Few kilometers from the Pont Drift is Platjan border post. This is the border post on the Botswana side from South Africa between Alldays and Selebi Pikwi on the Limpopo River. However, Platjan often floods during the rainy season (March/April). As a cautionary measure one is advised to call ahead to their destination for confirmation. Alternatively, once can use the border controls at Pontdrift or Zanzibar.Unfortunately, the situation is no different even at the nearby Zanzibar border. Navigation through gravel roads between the three ports of entry will also prove to be quite a daunting task since the roads are also damaged.Travellers to and from Botswana have had to use Groblers Bridge or Beit Bridge port of entries which make the trip much longer due to the temporary closer of the three borders, the long stretch of the Alldays that would have made it easier is full of potholes.Meanwhile, travelers remain fearful of entering the country through the Grobler Bridge Border saying rising water levels in the Limpopo River pose threats if it continues raining like it has in Botswana and the neighboring countries.Normal operations along the border still continue as it is yet to be clarified on how soon Home Affairs will open the closed ports of entry.
