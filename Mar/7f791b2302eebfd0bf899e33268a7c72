We are launching a concept that will foster individual mobility in this rapidly developing country and make the Rwandan market a further pillar of the Volkswagen brand s commitment to Africa, Mr. Sch fer said.The agreement will permit Volkswagen to begin assembling cars in Rwanda that are easy to maintain and that are low on fuel consumption and gas emission while also making it easy for the citizens to access and use the vehicles.The mega project will not only bring a plant to assemble Volkswagen cars but also service centres that will handle repairs and this is the kind of car people should start getting ready to buy.In line with the company s commitment to Rwanda and the training of local people, Volkswagen has pondered the possibility of cooperation with other German companies to establish a local technical academy to ease transfer of technology and skills, its officials said in a media release related to yesterday s agreement with Rwanda.Volkswagen is a German automaker founded by the German Labour Front and headquartered in Wolfsburg.
