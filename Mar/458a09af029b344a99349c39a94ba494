The department of Water Affairs National Water Week Awareness campaign will be taking place from March 17-23, to celebrate 20 years of water delivery water security in South Africa for social and economic development.Water treatment specialist Proxa is looking to the future of water in South Africa through the development of cost-effective and sustainable solutions for treating industrial effluent streams as well as the extraction of value from the same.Proxa Director of business development Elspeth Grahn says that water security, apart from being a concern with regard to human consumption and ensuring smooth running in industrial production process, it is also a determinant on the impact levels that future costs will have on South Africa.As a result, Proxa has focused on the development of solutions that optimize existing processes, making them more economically efficient by not producing waste.Grahn also asserts that authorities and industries in South Africa have taken a more proactive approach in working together to reduce water usage by recovering, reusing and recycling liquid waste streams. Water is an irreplaceable resource that is fundamental to all forms of life, which with increase in population causes an ever-increasing demand for water.Coupled with increased contamination of water as the industrial, manufacturing, power and mining sectors expand, the management and treatment of liquid waste streams remains critical in ensuring sustainable development in the country, she stressed.In 2016, Proxa developed effluent treatment solutions for Nestle, global Western Cape-based winery Rupert and Rothschild and beverage manufacturer AB InBev.In these cases, Grahn notes that the chief objectives were the overall reduction of water usage footprint, securing a water source, ensuring quality of recycled water for reuse in the plant processes and ultimately reducing the intake of fresh water.Grahn highlights that each of the above projects has a compact design, with minimal operator intervention. Proxa also provides its clients with technical service contracts that cover the ongoing optimisation, technical support, operation and maintenance of the units.Like any African country, water security in South Africa continues to be a major challenge despite
