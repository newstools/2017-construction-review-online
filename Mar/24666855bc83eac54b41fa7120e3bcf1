In Pinelands, it planned to provide 3 500 residential &#8220;opportunities&#8221; on 22ha of land.In the Belhar CBD, the province planned to construct 3 000 residential units near education facilities such as the University of the Western Cape and the Cape Peninsula University of Technology.However, this did not augur well with Reclaim the City, a subsidiary of Ndifuna Ukwazi, who termed the action &#8220;an insult to black and coloured working class people&#8221;. It went ahead to accuse the province of not paying heed to public interests.They also spoke of consultation with their lawyers, housing experts as well as supporters. The Western Cape African National Congress would as a result call on the provincial standing committee on transport and public works to launch an inquiry into the sale.ANC s Cameron Dugmore said they would file a complaint with the Public Protector to look into the matter as well.
