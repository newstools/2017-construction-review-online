The train was reportedly cruising at a speed of 120km per hour from Nairobi up to Mtito Andei, with all the rail communication modern systems in place.However, it took longer for the train to cruise after leaving Mtito Andei as they had opted to travel at much lower speeds since the signaling and communication system are yet to be complete. Work on the upgrade between Mombasa and Mtito Andei was set to reach completion today.On board the test drive passenger train were 21 rail experts from the SGR main consultant, TSDI APEC Edon Consortium, China Road and Bridges Corporation (CRBC), Kenya Railways management and staff, and engineers from manufacturers of the locomotives and coaches respectively.Kenya Railways Managing Director Atanas Maina explained CRBC, TAEC and KR s presence sighting completion acceptance tests. This is both in terms of the infrastructure and equipment, to ensure the standards expected by the client have been met.He added that the test runs are for checking whether the locomotives, wagons and coaches will run on the track without hitches.More tests are also being carried out on the entire signaling systems to examine capacity to recognize moving trains. He added that the speeds, reception and the dispatch from the stations, passenger comfort among others were also being checked. The tests are said to continue until May.
