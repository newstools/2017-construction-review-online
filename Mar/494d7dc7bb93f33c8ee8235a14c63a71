We&#8217;re also scheduling to export it to Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda,&#8221; the Chinese investor said.The proposed plant is estimated to begin in May and construction of their wharf will begin during the same time so that the produced cement can be hauled directly from the factory.Tanzania produces approximately seven-million tons of cement a year, with demand seen mounting at close to 10% per annum, according to government approximation.Cement consumption is seen as a gauge of construction activity, one of the main drivers of economic growth in the state.
