Operators within this facility stand to benefit from electricity rebates and a reduction in rental and transportation costs for delivering goods outside to the broader market, said Makue. We were also introduced on challenges of ageing infrastructure that are currently affecting the facility but we note with appreciation the revitalization efforts that are underway. The Ekandustria Industrial Park is recognised as a catalyst for broader economic and industrial development in the region and it is envisaged that once revitalised, it will enhance its investor occupancy rate, drive retention and expansion and also contribute to the economy of its surrounding areas and nationally.
