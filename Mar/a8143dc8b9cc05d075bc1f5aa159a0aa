Largest solar hybrid system in Kenya installed in Malindi for salt manufacturer Krystalline Salt. The 991kWp system is a PV-diesel hybrid project that will produce 1.6GWh of clean electricity yearly, saving Krystalline Salt about 22% of its electricity expenses.Also read:A rooftop solar system installed in South African beach resortLargest solar hybrid system in Kenya was developed in partnership with SMA subsidiary SMA Sunbelt, using its Fuel Save Controller which complements the diesel generator and works to make up for solar s fluctuating energy source for a coordinated delivery of power.The project was installed by local Kenyan installers Harmonic Systems, who managed to commission the project two months ahead of schedule. In terms of financial support, the project was made achievable through the government of Japan s Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) funding programme that assists low-carbon technologies in developing nations. We are very delighted to see this project complete in such a short period of time, given the countless challenges in doing a project in rural Africa, said Noriko Ishibashi, researcher of Pacific Consultants from Japan.Also read:Construction of East Africa s largest solar farm to start in earnest We believe this project will significantly contribute to the combined efforts between the Kenyan and Japanese governments to decrease greenhouse gas emissions under the bilaterally agreed JCM. The solar component of the system allows for a fossil fuel decline of about 24,000 liters of diesel yearly and at the same time a low maintenance solution. It will displace 1,268 tons of carbon dioxide and profit the neighboring Kenyan communities due to job creation during construction period.&#8220;As the project developer, it has been an honor to play a part in Kaysalt attaining their sustainability goals, and by making use of the JCM grant, delivering the solar system at the necessary ROI, said Johan Pienaar, commercial director of SolarAfrica. We applaud Kaysalt for making use of a cleaner energy option. Kaysalt has obviously set a new standard for industrial power users to pursue. We at SolarAfrica are ardent about solar energy and will keep on offering innovative clean energy solutions to facilitate commercial and industrial power users to smoothly shift to solar.
