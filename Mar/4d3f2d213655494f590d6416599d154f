One of the conclusions drawn from the discussion was that no amount of contract sophistication can replace trust needed to enable public and private organizations working together.One such successful collaboration would be the Mine Water Coordinating Body in the Mpumalanga coal mining area.There, coal mine companies and local government have carried out joint problem and opportunity analyses and are testing financial and institutional models for reducing pollution impacts from mining in the long term.SWPN further added the possibility of public and private sectors in South Africa as pathfinders in developing collective action partnerships that enable a trust-building environment for sustainable public-private-civil society partnerships.
