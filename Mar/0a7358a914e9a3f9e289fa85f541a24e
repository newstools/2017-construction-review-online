In line with its brand promise of strength beyond the bag , PPC Zimbabwe also launched its new Surecast 42.5R cement at the event, certainly a first for the country.The cement s increase in early strength makes it the ideal offering for small, medium and large contractors allowing new flexibility in mix designs, better brick yields and a total reduction in concrete cost for readymix, among others.With the Harare mill fully functioning and ready to meet demand, its official commissioning sees another milestone in the PPC Group s African expansion strategy achieved. Moyo also spoke of key developments in DRC and Ethiopia later on this year.
