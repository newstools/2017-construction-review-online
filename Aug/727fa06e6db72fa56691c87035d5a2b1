The Nigerian government has released $1.5Bn to the urban water sanitation sector through the National Urban Water Reform. This is according to the Minister of Water Resources Suleiman Adamu. The minister was speaking at the 24th regular meeting of the National Water Council in Akure, the Ondo State capital.

This is beside the European Union, USAID and JICA grants provided to support the project. Mr. Adamu said the reform project objectives will improve access to piped water in the project states. They will also be used to make the Water Agencies in a better financial position to deliver sustainable water service. Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, appealed to the federal government to give loans to state governments to repair some of the existing dams. These funds, according to him are deductable from the state allocation. In addition, he explained that most of the dams in the state are begging for attention. The Nigeria administration is thus committed towards providing water for the people of the state. He also revealed that the government is currently burdened with the construction of dams. This is with a view to making raw water available to the people. According to him, most of the major urban water supply schemes are now old and inadequate. As a result, it is harder for them to meet the ever-increasing population and water demand. In the end the governor called on the meeting to help in providing solution to the challenges of water supply confronting the state.
