The goal seeks to provide access to safe and affordable sanitation for all by 2030. According to the report more than three quarters of those without piped water supplies live in rural areas. in addition, only 20% of these can access improved sanitation. In cities, poor people are up to three times less likely to have piped water than people in better off areas. Nigeria’s Country Director for the World Bank, Rachid Benmessaoud said that the water and sanitation services need to improve. This, according to him, is to prevent looming consequences on health and well-being. He further urged governments to better inform people and encourage more household water treatment. Providing piped water in cities could generate economies of scale. This is according to the bank as it urged greater private-sector involvement in urban water provision. That is more so the case in areas where recovering costs may be easier. Researchers, decision makers and aid specialists are meeting in Stockholm for the annual World Water Week. The platform will will focus on how to reduce waste in water use.
