The largest airport in Senegal is set to be opened in December this year. Blaise Diagne International (AIBD) will now take over services from Senegal’s current flagship airport Léopold Sédar Senghor International in capital city Dakar, which will cease operations once the project is completed. Unlike many airports in Africa that are normally located near the capital, the new airport will be located in rural Diass, around 40km East of Dakar. Its location was informed by the need for space and diversification of the economy out of the capital Dakar. “The idea is to see if we could drag economic activities out of Dakar,” says AIBD Deputy Director General El Hadji Ibrahima Mané. “New infrastructure is essential to this ambition,” he added.
