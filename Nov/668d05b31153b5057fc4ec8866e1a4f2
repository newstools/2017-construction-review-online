A total of 30 bamboo water tanks and two water kiosks were constructed to ease access to clean and safe water for residents in Bugesera District, Rwanda. Takayuki Miyashita, the Japanese ambassador to Rwanda officially launched the US $74,150 facilities late last week. The Embassy of Japan funded the project in conjunction with Rwanda Environmental Conservation Organization (RECOR). This is under the project for improvement of access to clean water in the district. Bugesera District is one of the areas experiencing scarcity of water; residents sometimes resort to fetching water from unsafe sources. While inaugurating and handing over the facilities to the District in Musenyi sector, Amb. Miyashita thanked the implementers for constructing the facilities successfully. The envoy expects that the facilities will lead to women participation and increase income-generating activities. They will also serve to allow children have time to go to school instead of trekking distances to fetch water.

According to her, the next step is the sensitization of people on proper management to ensure sustainability. Priscilla Uwiragiye, the Bugesera vice-mayor in charge of social affairs, said the district is proud of hosting projects that impact lives of residents. Uwiragiye said the support will mostly benefit vulnerable residents. She called upon the beneficiaries not to take the facilities for granted instead take good care of them. The facilities come as a relief to the residents as they will no longer have to walk long distances for water. The students would also attend school on time.
