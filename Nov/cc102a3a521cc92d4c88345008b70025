This is according to the census conducted in 2012. Eng, Sanga noted that the completion of this project will see the production of more than 7.25m litres from the current 900,000 litres of water. Supporting Eng Sanga’s comments, Magu District Executive Director Lutengano George said the completion of the project will also reduce the challenges that area residents faced looking for clean water for domestic use and consumption. Meanwhile, in Misungwi District, the project will reach 23,315 residents in Misungwi town and in Nyahiti Village. The managing director said Mwauwasa was expecting to construct two water storage tanks within the city, which will have the capacity of holding 3,000,000 liters daily.
