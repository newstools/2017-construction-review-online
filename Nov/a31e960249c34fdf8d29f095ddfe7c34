A 750m tonne cement plant is set for construction on a 20-hectare piece of land in Mariakani, Kilifi County. It will cost a whooping US $290m and will be the second factory in the area after ARM Cement. Building material billionaire Narendra Raval plans to invest in the mega project at a time when other players in the industry are complaining of excess capacity. Bamburi and Savannah cement also plan to increase cement production in the near future. Mr. Raval confirmed the news and said that the construction of the new plant will eventually lead to the reduction of cement prices in the country as well as reducing the distance of transportation of the product to Kenyans.

Mr Raval, who is popularly known as Guru, owns a cement grinding plant in Lukenya, Machakos and a clinkering plant at Simba town, Kajiado.

The plant will cost US$ 48m and will be located in Athi River, Machakos County.
