The new Mombasa-Nairobi oil pipeline is set for commissioning before the end of December this year. This is according to the Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter. The launch will come as a relief to road users as the pipeline is expected to ease traffic along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. It will also significantly improve supplies and stability in Nairobi, Kisumu and their environs. The new 20-inch 450-km oil pipeline from Mombasa to Nairobi is 97% complete. Mr Keter further added that said pipeline will ensure the country has a stable petroleum cover. He further added that the pipeline will serve the purpose of de-congesting traffic congestion along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway.

The CS also said plans to roll out low-cost liquid petroleum gas (LPG) were at a very advanced stage, with the target launch before Christmas. According to him, the move will increase penetration of alternative forms of energy. This is with reference to commonly used sources like charcoal and kerosene. The government is looking to phase out the latter in the long term due to the environmental impact.
