An INMESOL 1110 kVA LTP generator set model IP-1135 has been recently installed at the Alphonse Massemba-Débat sports complex, located at the city of Brazaville, capital of the Republic of Congo. This stand-by genset will be in charge of supplying electrical power in the event of a failure in the mains. The generator set features a Perkins engine soundproofed by a double soundproofing panel and installed in a 40-feet container. This makes it a very quiet equipment despite the large amount of power it is capable of supplying. The Alphonse Massemba-Débat stadium hosts matches from the Republic of Congo Football team, as well as from several local clubs that play at the National Football League. It also has an athletics track. This unique stadium was the venue chosen to host the 1965 All-Africa Games and the 2004 African Championships in Athletics. It has a capacity to receive approximately 3000 people. Inmesol’s Administrative, Manufacturing and Production Centre is located in Corvera, 20Km from Murcia, in southeast Spain.
