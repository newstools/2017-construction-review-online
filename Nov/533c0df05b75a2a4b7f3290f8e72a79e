The laying of tracks of Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail line is expected to kick start in December 2017. This is according to Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi. Due to the construction of the rail line, the Jibowu and Costain bridges in Lagos will be demolished to give way for the new railway lines. Executing the project is the China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC).

But we are rebuilding them immediately; we are not going to abandon them,” said Minister Amaechi. “The challenges will be in the cities like Lagos, Abekouta and Ibadan because we have to pay compensation, look at the water pipes, gas pipes, houses and cables. In Lagos especially, we deal with bridges, electric cables and water pipes and other assets,” he added. Nonetheless, the CCECC is consulting with Lagos State Water Corporation, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation( NNPC), among others, to facilitate relocation of water and gas pipe lines that  are parallel to railway line. Parts of the rail lines that would be used for the project are expected to arrive in the country by end of November.
