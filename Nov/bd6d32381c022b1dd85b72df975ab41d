This will enable the country to meet the growing demand in the capital city and its environs. It also aims to replace out-of-date equipment in order to reduce energy losses and remove overloads. This, in turn, will improve the quality of electricity supply. It will also help address the connection backlog of an estimated 432,000 customers, occasioned by inadequate distribution system capacity. The Bank’s intervention is in line  with Ethiopia’s long-term development blueprint, the Growth and Transformational Plan II (2016-2020), which includes energy infrastructure development as the main pillar of the nine priority areas.
