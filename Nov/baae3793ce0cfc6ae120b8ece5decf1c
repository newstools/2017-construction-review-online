The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has commissioned a number of road projects in Delta state worth US$10m. The roads include the Tebu-Gbokoda road in Olero Creek community, Udo-Ajamita road and drainages, Ireto road in Sapele and Uloho Avenue road in Ughelli Speaking during the project inspection NDDC Managing Director Nsima Ekere, said that the construction of the road projects aim to improve the life of people in the Niger Delta communities by providing them quality infrastructure. According to him, the projects are expected to withstand the region’s rough terrain as well as providing comfortable transportation to the lives of the residents.

Besides, the proposed road projects are a result of demands from the residents to create alternative route from Delta to Lagos state, and the commission had to take a quick step after the strategic road became inaccessible. “When I heard that the NDDC was coming to work on the Uloho Avenue, I was skeptical because I felt the road would be abandoned like most government projects. But, I became impressed when I saw the speed at which the work was going and the quality of work done,” said Obrik Miller Uloho, life chairman of the Ughelli council of chiefs. He further urged the NDDC to construct the roads in other areas of Ughelli which are presently in unreachable condition.
