The Northern Water Collector tunnel is also in line with Vision 2030 to ensure improvement on water services in Nairobi, Kiambu and Muranga Counties. Karimenu II Dam will have a daily capacity of 76,000 cubic metres. It will also sustain demand for areas like Kiambu, Juja, Ruiru, and the Export Processing Zones. The completion of the dam will ease pressure on Ndakaini, Sasumua, and Ruiru dams. The three supply fresh water to Nairobi and its environs. Sonko also said he will partner with the Water and Irrigation Ministry. The partnership will aid in drilling at least one borehole in every ward in Nairobi. They agreed to request the National Government through the Equalization Fund to subsidize water. This will help citizens from the informal sector within Nairobi access water.
