The Kenyan government in conjunction with a Chinese firm AVIC International Kenya, has decided to embark on a program that will enhance training and mentorship for youth who are keen in working the construction industry. The program will be funded by several Chinese firms. Dinah Mwinzi, Principal Secretary in the State Department of Technical and Vocational Training under the Ministry of Education confirmed the reports and said that the program’s goal is to refine the technical expertise of young people and enhance their employability in the sectors of building and construction. “We are proud to witness this year’s Africa Technology Challenge (ATC) focus on civil engineering disciplines like masonry, carpentry and steel works. The challenge will empower youth from different backgrounds,” said Dinah. Senior officials witnessed the launch of season four of the African Technology Challenge (ATC), funded by AVIC International. The fourth program of ATC – Jenga Vijana or empower the youth, combines skills upgrade and employment opportunities for Kenyan youth in the construction sector. Zhao Leilei, Project Manager with AVIC International Kenya, pointed out that improving civil engineering expertise in Kenya among the youth is important in promoting the economic growth and industrialization in the country. “This year’s Africa Technology Challenge will see the participants progressing well with their civil construction skills while earning an income throughout the competition period,” Zhao said. The program will benefit more than 100 Kenyan youth. Their skills will be advanced in civil engineering disciplines like carpentry, steel works and brick laying to be provided by AVIC International.
