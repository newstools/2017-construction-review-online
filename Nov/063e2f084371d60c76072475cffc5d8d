The Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority in Momba District, Songwe Region have started implementing two big water projects. The US $10.3m projects which are to reach completion in the next two years will help address the water shortage in the region. Despite being famous for various business undertakings, Tunduma Town is currently facing water shortage. As such, residents have to travel long distances in search of water from rivers and streams. A 20-litre container of water goes for less than a dollar (Tsh. 300). Speaking about the shortage facing Tunduma residents earlier on this week, Momba district commissioner Jumaa Irando said the first project costing about US $400,500 is on course. It will serve the following wards – Sogea, Makambini, Mwakakati and Muungano – with 23,839 villagers.

He also added that a feasibility study on the same is complete. Drilling will begin towards the end of this year. Tunduma Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority manager Justin Munishi said water demand for Tunduma Town stood at 7,187 cubic metres per day. However, only 1,992 cubic metres is supplied currently. Mr. Munishi added that the first project’s completion will ensure an increase in water supply from 34.3% to 57.5%. This is owing to the ongoing work to construct two water reservoirs with the storage capacity of 400 cubic metres. The water problem is as a result of lack of reliable water sources, dilapidated water infrastructure and poor water supply networks. The contractor of the projects from Best One Limited, Mr Emmanuel Masika, said the construction of the water reservoirs started on August 4, this year and will reach completion on November 25.
