ANN SACKS Basillio is a porcelain collection company from Italy that takes its cues from limestone, replicating the demarcations, inclusions and small fossilized remnants that create its unique organic character. In a soft palette of Clay, Oyster and Slate, Basillio has a natural, slightly textured surface and the strength and durability that continue to make porcelain a savvy choice for commercial and residential installations. Offered in 24”x24” field tiles, this through body porcelain tile is suitable for indoor wall and flooring applications. It also adapts to the outdoors with ease based upon method of installation as freeze/thaw conditions do not impede Basillio’s resilient nature. Competitively priced, Basillio can meet even the tightest of budgets to fit large scale commercial or residential projects. Additional sizes and colors are available by special order.
