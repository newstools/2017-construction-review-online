The Water Infrastructure Investment Summit (WIIS) will be held in South Africa to address water infrastructure buildup in the country. The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) will host the summit later on this month. This is in collaboration with the Water Research Commission (WRC). WIIS aims to promote investment in all aspects of water infrastructure. Key stakeholders will engage in a program of action to create an enabling environment for investment and inclusive growth opportunities. The WIIS aims to prioritize the critical requirement for partnerships in the water industry. According to Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, South Africa currently relies on a constrained resource. Furthermore, variable degrees of rainfall highly determine surface water resources. This in turn greatly impacts water availability in the country.

This is higher than the global average of 173 litres a person.  Another aspect of consumption that requires urgent intervention is extensive “backward” irrigation solutions. This is because it accounts for as much as 60% of national water consumption. A post-event stewardship program will be held for 12 months after WIIS. This is to exploit and capitalize on key points raised during the WIIS. The measures will ensure the institution of several of these points as well as development to certain a degree.
