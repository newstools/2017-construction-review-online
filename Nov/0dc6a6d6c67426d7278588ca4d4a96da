A modern Indoor Sports Complex is set to be constructed in Nigeria at Gyadi Gyadi by the Kano State government; this is according to the state governor Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. “This is part of the resolution to improve sports activities in the state because of its potential for physical development, revenue generation and an avenue for image management,” he stated. Additionally, one mini stadium will also be constructed in the three Senatorial zones of the state.

Also, 44 local government councils also contributed US$ 416,000 in their respective domains. The governor further appealed to the private sector to invest more in sports development by encouraging teams through grants, donations, advertisement and other measures. “Investors can promote their products and services through sporting events and sports team. For instance, they can advertise using Kano Pillars Basketball team or Kano Pillars Para Soccer team, because they are popular and viable teams,” he said. Earlier this year, Super Eagles star Ahmed Musa contributed a whooping US$ 1.4m on a sports complex in his home city, Kano. Musa spent some years in Kano during his years as a player for Kano Pillars where he played for two seasons. The facility has two five-a-side pitches, a gymnasium, lounge, restaurant and a large multipurpose events hall. The footballer who plays for Leicester City as a forward said that the sports complex will serve as a venue for the football loving people of Kano to train. Aside from the opening of the sports complex, he has other plans lined up in Nigeria in the coming days.
