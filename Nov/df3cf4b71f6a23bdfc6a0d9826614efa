The Society of Real Estate Developers of Nigeria (SOREDON) has emerged to support the government in tackling Nigeria’s prevalent housing deficit. As such, the Society is to construct and deliver 10,000 housing units for each of the 37 states in Nigeria. This is contingent upon the federal government providing adequate land in each of the states. The lands must come with complete titled documents for the land provided. A guaranteed take off for the completed project is also a requirement. The society shall build for each of the local government a standard modern market on the stream of the local government. Additionally, a modern functional health centre in collaboration with the federal ministry of health is also in the works. This is courtesy of the local government.
