Line is the new Bath+ by Cosmic’s proposal, aimed at furnishing today’s bathroom with accessories and complements that offer a modern look. Designed by Ricard Ferrer, it adapts to neutral decoration and more informal settings. Not only does the new collection stand out for its versatility, but also because it seeks convenient installation. Thus, it can be attached by means of conventional screws or 3M adhesive tape, depending on the choice of the end-user. These options make it easy to hang a towel bar on the side of the furniture or install a towel rack shelf in the shower area without drilling. Another of Line’s features is its solid components, which offer the utmost reliability and remain unchanged over time. The proposal is born out of a basic concept: a simple ribbon. “A taut gesture that swivels and becomes a functional object. The challenge throughout the collection has been to keep the clean idea to the final product, without adding elements that distract and compete with the main concept”, explains the Barcelona designer, who has created many successful collections for Cosmic. The original shape is repeated across the entire range, allowing the square of the free standing complements, such as the waste bin or the toilet brush, to smooth out their lines with rounded angles. The complete collection consists of: a hook, free standing brush-holder and soap dispenser, container and corner container, towel ring, towel bar (40/60 cm.), towel rack shelf, paper holder with and without cover, free standing toilet brush and waste bin (5 litre capacity and hinged lid). All items have a 10-year guarantee. PRESS CONTACT Industrias Cosmic, s.a.u. Marta Queralt mqueralt@icosmic.com www.icosmic.com +34 93 865 42 77
