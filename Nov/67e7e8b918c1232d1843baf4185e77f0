The Lagos State government has flagged off construction of the access road to the Murtala Muhammed International Airport after receiving the necessary approval from the Federal Government. The project also involves rehabilitation of a segment of the 10-lane Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonsoki federal highway, and the expansion of the link to the international airport terminal. Additionally, the access road will be reconstructed into a 10-lane expressway in which three express lanes will be separated from two lanes for local traffic for the abutting Ajao Estate and Mafoluku.
