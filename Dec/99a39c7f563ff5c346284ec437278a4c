Caterpillar is introducing a new tier of repair and replacement parts to support the small- and medium-sized equipment under its Construction Industries umbrella. Yellowmark, A Caterpillar Brand, parts will offer an alternative for customers looking for reliable, value-priced parts, the company says. The parts will be available from the Cat dealer network. “Many of our Building Construction Products (BCP) and Global Construction & Infrastructure (GCI) equipment customers have given us feedback that their operations need more options on repair and replacement parts as they seek the right balance between convenience and reliability at a lower cost, especially for older equipment,” said Nigel Lewis, Caterpillar CMO & VP. “Through Yellowmark we will provide a range of products that respond to these needs. Yellowmark repair and replacement parts build on the current range of Caterpillar new and remanufactured solutions to provide more options to customers as they work to optimize the owning and operating costs.” Caterpillar said Yellowmark parts will encompass and expand on the Cat Classic Parts line. As part of the new brand, new offerings will be added over time to that line to ensure a full range of parts for BCP and GCI equipment. These new parts offerings will be introduced throughout 2018 and will initially include repair and replacement parts. Future new parts introductions will include maintenance and wear parts. The Yellowmark brand joins the premium Cat Genuine and Cat Reman parts lines at Caterpillar dealers.
