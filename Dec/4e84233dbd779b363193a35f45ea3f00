The City Park Hockey Stadium in Nairobi, Kenya is set to undergo a mega face-lift that will see it host international tournaments in the future. The renovation of the stadium will cost US $242,000. The Fédération Internationale de Hockey (FIH) and Africa Hockey Federation (AHF) have since handed the renovation contract to Greenfields and Naema Construction and Engineering Limited. Kenya Hockey Union president Nashon Randiek confirmed the reports and said that that the union is in talks with the government and other stake holders to assist in funding the project. He pointed out that it will take almost a year to raise the funds before the project commences. “Greenfields works in collaboration with FIH and Africa Hockey making the project ideal and that is why it was recommended to us because this is one of their appointed companies and they are also going to provide a guarantee. We have a year to look for funds and we are in talks with the government. They will give a percentage of the total cost and we have to work with other stake holders to raise the additional funds we are confident that within that one year the funds will be ready.” Randiek said. According to Sophcles Sophocleous, the Sales Manager at Greenfield, the renovation targets the sub base, shock pads, drainage and lighting. The turf at the stadium was placed in 1997 and has worn out over time hence the need for the upgrade. The new turf to be laid is projected to have polyethylene surface. The sub base at the stadium is concrete and drainage has been an issue due to the non-permeable shock pad.
