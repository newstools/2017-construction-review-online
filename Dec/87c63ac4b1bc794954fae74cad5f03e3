Hazina Trade Towers in Nairobi, Kenya will only reach a maximum of 15 floors instead of the planned 39. This is majorly due to structural weaknesses that cannot support the initial planned 180 metres. The National Social Security Fund says it will complete the building at its current height which of 15 floors. Construction was stopped in October 2016 over safety concerns, when the beams were found not be strong enough to support a building of such a height. Anthony Munyiri, an NSSF trustee, confirmed the reports and said that at the moment, NSSF is seeking approvals from the County Government of Nairobi to complete the building.

An audit inspection carried out on January 14, 2016 by Mr. Ouko revealed that the work had stalled after reaching 15th floor or at 38%. His report further revealed that NSSF has been unable to proceed with the construction of the building after a dispute with its anchor tenant- Nakumatt Lifestyle. The tenant has denied the contractor access to the basement floors, contrary to the provisions of the lease agreement signed in 2003; this is according to Mr. Ouko in his audit report tabled in the National Assembly recently. Hazina Trade Towers was meant to feature in the league of Africa’s tallest buildings. Construction of the mega building was to take three years for it to be complete. But since its commencement in June 2013, the building is still not yet complete.
