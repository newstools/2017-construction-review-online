The Port of Abidjan in Ivory Coast is undergoing a major expansion with the aim of cementing its position as one of West Africa’s leading commercial hubs. Moreover, a second container terminal is also being constructed to increase the port’s cargo capacity. The goal is to be able to host larger, new generation vessels, regardless of their size. According to Yacouba Sié CEO of the Autonomous Port of Abidjan, when the project is complete the port of Abidjan will be able to accommodate ships carrying 14,000 containers. “Here at the port of Abidjan, we can accommodate vessels with a draft of up to 11,5 metres, that is to say no more than 3.500 containers,” said Yacouba Sié. The China Harbor Engineering Company is executing the project. Already huge concrete blocks are being built on site that will make up the wharf. The new terminal will spread over land gained on the lagoon.
