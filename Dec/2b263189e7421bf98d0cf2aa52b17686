Dangote Cement has come to an agreement with Jumia Nigeria to sell their cement to customers online. This initiative will eventually assist in the reduction of the cement price and ease logistics inherent in the purchase of products. Interested buyers and corporate bodies can now easily order on Jumia to purchase a minimum of 300 bags of 50kg of Dangote Cement and above at a reasonable price of US $6.92 per bag. Jumia Nigeria is one of the leading e-commerce platforms in the country. Chux Mogbolu, Account Director of Dangote Cement confirmed the reports and said that the new partnership is a great one and is now live in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt. “For now, the pilot scheme is live in Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt, but we can extend to other cities depending on the level of demand and performance of the new deal,” he added. With the deal, Nigerians in need of seamless supply of cement from Dangote can now place orders and pay online and wait for the delivery in record time from any of Dangote’s nearest cement plants in Lagos, Port Harcourt or Abuja. He further pointed out that the new venture is anticipated to help arrest the scams perpetrated by online fraudsters who deceive people. Dangote Cement Plc is a Nigerian multinational publicly traded cement manufacturer headquartered in Lagos. The company is engaged in the manufacture, preparation, import, packaging, and distribution of cement and related products across the African continent.
