The minister urged the people to work hard to drill the four boreholes, construct weirs and harvest water. She also said that the program will continue until the whole country is covered. Command Water Harvesting program aims to transform livelihoods of people. Under the program are dam constructions as well as small weirs on rivers to allow for the collection of water during the rainy season. The program will see ZINWA provide technical supervision during the construction period. Moreover, communities under the guidance of their local leadership structures will mobilize resources such as cement, rocks, labor and other materials. The program will also include de-silting of silted water bodies. The local leadership is also critical in the identification of areas in their respective wards to build the weirs.
