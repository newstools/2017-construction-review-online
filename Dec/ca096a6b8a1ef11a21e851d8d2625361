New Africa headquarters for Deloitte audit firm are set to be constructed in Johannesburg, South Africa. The company recently celebrated the commencement of construction of the iconic building. The 42,500 metres squared ultra‐modern offices are anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of 2020 and Deloitte plans to start operating from its new base as from April in 2020. The new premises will then consolidate Deloitte’s current Woodmead and Pretoria offices into a single central location at Waterfall. Atterbury chief executive, Louis van der Watt confirmed the reports and said that he believed that their deep understanding of Deloitte’s operational business needs will ensure the project’s success in the years ahead. “This development will not only provide Deloitte with room to grow as a business, but also be an asset that supports them in attracting new talent and continuing to serve their expanding market,” van der Watt said. South African property investment company Atterbury Property and JSE‐listed premier property company Attacq Limited joined the audit firm. Atterbury and Attacq are co‐owners in a 50/50 joint venture on the new development. Mike Jarvis, Chief Operating Officer at Deloitte Africa, was pleased with the initiative and said that they were excited about their new custom-designed headquarters that will enable them expand their client portfolio and also serve their customers better. “This new centre of operation gears our Africa Firm to attract the best talent, serve our expanding market, and consolidate approximately 3700 of our people to make an even greater impact with our clients and communities,” Jarvis said. The building, which will enjoy prime positioning alongside the Allandale interchange of the N1 highway, has space capacity for close to 5,000 people and promises Deloitte prominent highway frontage at the eastern side of Waterfall City as well as its clients and talent easy and quick access to its premises.
