A 250MW wind farm is set to be put up in Egypt through a renewable power generation joint venture (JV) between Lekela and investment firm Actis. The site will be in northeast Egypt within a build, own and operate (BOO) framework. The two companies have also initialed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the state-owned Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) that will see the project become a success.

He pointed out that the financial close and the start of construction are expected to take place next year. “This is part of our long-term strategic plan to deliver renewable energy to Egypt and support the diversification of its generation capacity at a highly competitive price,” he said. “Generating clean, renewable and competitively priced power continues to be a priority in many African countries and we are looking forward to further announcements in South Africa, Ghana and Senegal in due course,” he added. The mega wind farm will be located approximately 30km northwest of Ras Ghareb. The area has a good strong wind resource, which should deliver high capacity factors and enable the competitive sale of power. Further to this project, Lekela has also completed two 140MW South African wind farms this month. The neighbouring Loeriesfontein and Khobab projects in the west of the country each comprise of 61 of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SWT-2.3-108 turbines. The Lekela JV was launched in February 2015 with the aim of developing up to 900MW of wind and solar projects in Africa by 2018.
