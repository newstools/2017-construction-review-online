Construction work on a 16km gas pipeline of the Angola LNG plant to the Soyo combined cycle power station in northern Zaire province is complete and the plant is ready for full operation. This development was released to journalists at the end of a working visit of a few hours, by the State Secretaries of Energy and Petroleum, António Fernandes Belsa and Paulino Jerónimo, respectively in the oil municipality of Soyo. They further explained that the visit was mainly organized to accompany the commissioning entry of the power plant, in which Sonagás and Sonangol have increased responsibilities to bring the gas to feed the energy complex. However, they affirmed that there is still some fine tuning of machines taking place in the plant to ensure efficient gas reception from the gas pipeline and the consequent production of electricity. They also revealed that in the last week of November, there were some commissioning tests of the infrastructure, whose tests of the equipment went smoothly.
