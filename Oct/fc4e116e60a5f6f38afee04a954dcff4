Transnet Rail Freight Chief Executive Officer Ravi Nair says that the 150 kilometre railway line will run from Lothair in South Africa to Sidvokodvo in Swaziland. The project will also involve modernizing two existing lines in both countries. According to Ravi Nair the Swazi rail link design is to open up a dedicated general freight corridor.
