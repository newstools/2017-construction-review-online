The African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) is set to construct trade centres in Zimbabwe; this is according to the President, Dr. Benedict Oramah. They intend to transform the buildings into iconic business complexes with integrated one-stop trade services shop. The complexes, Afreximbank – Africa Trade Centres, will help in the creation of mini business parks for African trade. The development will have several features such as a large auditorium conference centre; a trade information centre; corporate rental office space for trade promoting bodies, export credit agencies, commercial banks among other things. Additionally, not only will there be a small business innovation and incubation hub but also up market lavish offices; high end shops and restaurants and public facilities, including a gymnasium and also a food court.

Moreover, it will further cement a relationship that will demonstrate reliability beyond doubt. Afreximbank is the foremost pan-African multilateral financial institution devoted to financing and promoting intra- and extra-African trade. The Bank has been in existence since October 1993 by African governments, African private and institutional investors, and non-African investors. Its two basic constitutive documents are the Establishment Agreement, which gives it the status of an international organization, and the Charter, which governs its corporate structure and operations.
