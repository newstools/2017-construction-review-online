Entebbe International Airport expansion is likely to take longer than planned after the contractor, China Communications and Construction Company (CCCC) said it has run into trouble with a land owner and locals. A clan in Buganda is claiming part of the project land, while people in Mukono have taken court action to stop stone quarrying in their area, thereby affecting CCCC’s supply of rock aggregate. The Chinese firm, like others involved in big infrastructure projects, was operating under President Museveni’s directive to use local materials, in order to support Ugandan businesses, but residents say the blasting of stone has become an environmental hazard.

Sun Guicai, project manager, CCCC, said that from their five-year contract to upgrade Uganda’s only international airport, they have covered 28% of the works. “We only have one stone quarry site gazetted for us to get airport-standard aggregate, which is the first material in construction,” he said. “On September 24, Mukono court issued an order stopping us from quarrying until November 6, when court will resume,” Sun said. The injunction, he said, is a major drawback since this was the only site the government had assigned to CCCC. Sun said the company paid the agreed compensation to the people but 10 months down the road, they got a lawyer and went to court.
