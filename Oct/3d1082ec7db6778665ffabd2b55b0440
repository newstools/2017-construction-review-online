Members of the Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Lagos Chapter, have called for strategies and policies to combat flooding in the country. They spoke during the 2017 Annual General Meeting of the body. The Chairman of NITP Lagos Kunle Salami, said threats from flooding in Lagos and other parts of the country, necessitates the need for an all-inclusive approach to address the menace. He further called upon both the government as well as the general public to adequately equip themselves with strategies to face such challenges. Mr. Luka Achi, the President of NITP, said the country was still dealing with floods that have taken over several of our settlements. He further made an observation that various governments are spending on relief materials rather than investing in sustainable measures to solve the problem. Hakeem Ogunbambi, guest speaker at the event said the topography of Lagos, put the state at a disadvantage. This is because the water from Ogun River Oyo and adjourning states naturally flow into the state. As a result, the state is being plagued by coastal area flooding due to the backlog of the lagoon. This also includes estuaries and coastlands with ocean wave and high tidal levels. Ogunbambi, a retired Permanent Secretary from the Lagos Civil Service and an expert on flood, revealed that human activities also have a part to play. Activities such as building or erecting structure on flood plain and dumping of refuse in drainages are major causes of the flooding. Mr. Olusegun Emdin, Coordinating Consultant/Chief Executive, MEPAS & PRODEL Nig. Limited, said Lagos state must reach out to other states. This will help it successfully overcome the challenges from flooding. Moses Ogunleye said, most times, we make noise during emergency, and immediately after a window-dressing approach we go to sleep.
