The 10MW Tororo solar plant in Eastern Uganda has been officially opened. This is the first photovoltaic (PV) system in Uganda, and also one of the largest solar plants in eastern Africa, creating around 16GWh/y of energy. The plant will foster clean industrial development in Tororo. This will save atmospheric emissions of more than 7,200 tonnes per year of carbon dioxide. The Tororo Solar North will also increase Uganda’s stock of installed electricity-generating infrastructure. It will also be lowering the average cost of electricity across the country. “Just 12 months from signing the debt finance agreement, the plant is fully productive and contributing to Uganda’s economic development,” said David White, EAIF Chairman. “The combination of  the Ugandan government, skilled developers and development finance institutions with deep experience of Africa and renewable energy projects shows that the infrastructure foundations for economic progress can be now be faster than at any time in history.” Also read:Off-grid solar set to power up Africa A year ago, the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund (EAIF) supplied part of the funding – that added up to US $14.7m – for the project’s construction. Netherlands-based FMO led the syndicate to finance the solar farm that now has a total capital development value of US $19.6m. Building Energy, the Italian company who developed and operate the farm, provided 300 local jobs during construction. It will also provide permanent jobs to those in the area now that the plant has opened for business.
