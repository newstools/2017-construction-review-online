Relaunching of a vigorous metering programme in Plateau, Bauchi, Benue, and Gombe states is already underway.

They therefore expect alot of cooperation. He went on to warn that any customer stealing electricity by bypassing the meters will be taken to court. According to him they will no longer tolerate Electricity theft, which is a criminal offense. Mr. Gidado stated that one major challenge experienced by JED in its meter roll out programme was meter rejection by some customers. This is on the belief that the meters being deployed were  not properly calibrated and were not certified by Nigerian Electricity Management. He was also  glad to report that the issue is past tense  as they took  the meters  to NEMSA certification center. Consequently this is where confirmation that the meters are  functioning properly took place. Mr. Ja’afaam Wuyep is the Commissioner for Water Resources and Energy. He represented Governor Simon Lalong, who commended JED for taking feedback from customers. He also added that they are a responsible government and they will not sit back and watch the people suffer. Some members of the state House of Assembly, who spoke on behalf of their constituents, and other customers gave A myriads of complaints. This was regarding hiked billing, estimated billing, requests for customers to pay for transformers, electricity poles, and meters by JED‎.
