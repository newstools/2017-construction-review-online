The facility enables the solar company to expand their offerings and reach more people living without access to energy. The syndication was led by SunFunder, with each lender providing US $2m to the facility. SunFunder, acting as the arranger, lender and also a facility agent, arranged the US $6m facility with social investor Oikocredit and an energy fund focusing on energy access and managed by responsAbility Investments as co-investors. According to SunFunder CEO, Ryan Levinson the customers need more scalable, less time-consuming financing options. This is important so they can focus on their core business delivering solar energy. “Furthermore, by leading syndications, SunFunder offers solar companies larger ticket size loans with less hassle. We are glad to build on our long-standing relationship with SolarNow and bring in additional investors,” he said.
