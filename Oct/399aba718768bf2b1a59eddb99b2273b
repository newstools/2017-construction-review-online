The former Commissioner for Lands in the state urged governments to consider trends in income and wealth in policy formulation to address the challenges of affordable housing.  He further added that the government should put in place rent control legislation. This, according to him, will help curb landlords’ excesses and protect the rights of tenants. Mr. Rowland Kayalga, Director, United Nations Information Centre, Lagos, commended the state government for its efforts in ensuring an inclusive, safe, resilient, sustainable, affordable and accessible housing for residents. In his remarks, Mr Abiola Anifowoshe, state Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development said that making housing available and within the reach of the common man was a major priority of the government.
