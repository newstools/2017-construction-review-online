The Government of Algeria has installed an HIMOINSA generator set in its new water treatment plant in the new city of Ali Mendjeli, at Constantine; to ensure that the plant can run in the event of a mains failure. The plant, purifies 4,200 cubic metres of water per hour. It serves a population of 260,000 and a large proportion of the purified water is reused for agricultural irrigation. The generator has an uninterrupted running time of 48 hours, thanks to an external 20,000-litre tank and a redundant transfer system that guarantees the plant’s power supply in the event of a mains failure. Mr. JAVIER VECINO, the Hydraulic Infrastructure Manager at SICE (ACS Group) said that they chose HIMOINSA because of how they compared in technical and economic terms. “We needed a first-class generator, with a combustion engine, and local service that was also very much appreciated by the customer,” he added. The model installed is the HTW-1530 T5, fitted with a Mitsubishi engine, and capable of supplying up to 1660kVA of stand-by power. In addition, it has a large external tank with a 20,000-litre capacity, which gives the generator enough running time to work for 48 hours. To ensure it works smoothly during this time, a redundant transfer system has been installed to transfer fuel from the external tank to the generator. The pumps have been programmed with a start-up delay, so that if the first pump does not start up, the second is already full and ready to transfer fuel to the generator. According to Azeddine Yekhlef, Regional Director of the Algerian Ministry, it is very important to have a specialized and professional local service to carry out maintenance and repairs on the generator set. “The machines work constantly, so we need them to be in perfect condition when they are required,” he said.
