10 estates in Nairobi will have interrupted water supply from Thursday 6am to Friday 6am due to the closure of the Outering Road pipeline by the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company (NCWSC); this is according to a public notice released earlier on this week. The company asked residents to store water and use it sparingly before and during the interruption. The shutdown comes during the Water Week celebration at the Kenya Water Institute (KEWI) in South C, Nairobi County.

The main objective of the Water Week is to pass knowledge on water management. It also serves to  improve the quality of water and waste water management in Kenyan and German industries. This comes after the company made an announcement about said the volume of water at the Ndakaini dam, having dropped to 29 % because of drought in catchment areas. Moreover, taps in several city estates have already run dry and NWSC warned the situation will worsen if rains do not fall soon. NCWSC manager for corporate affairs Mbaruku Vyakweli said that the present condition worsens by the day due to lack of rain. It is so bad that in some areas residents have not accessed water for the past three weeks NCWSC supplies 550 million cubic metres of water in the city, short200 m cubic metres of the demand.
