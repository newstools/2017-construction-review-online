The Kariba South Extension project in Zimbabwe is on course for completion in 2018. The project which was initiated by the Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) due to an acute power shortfall in the country, is currently 85% complete. The project will inject two 150 MW units at Kariba South Power Station and two 300 MW units at Hwange Power Station. This is to meet the peak power demand of 2 200 MW. Presently, the country depends on the available capacity of only 1 500 MW. Hatch began working on the Kariba South Extension Project in 2011, with a comprehensive review of all documentation and study material to date. The Kariba South Extension Project is divided into four distinct phases. Phase 1 involved project inception and review. Procurement made up Phase 2. Additionally, in order to produce a tender document, an Expression of Interest was issued. It is from these that Hatch narrowed the potential candidates down to five. Phase 4 involves commissioning and handover, then a two-year warranty period. Project Manager Geoffrey Lee points out that presently, Hatch is responsible for design reviews of the equipment. According to Global Director Marie-Hélène Briand, the project demands close monitoring and focus. It is also Zimbabwe’s largest infrastructure since their independence.

Hatch also has a strong presence in China, and is able to carry out in-factory quality inspections of all manufactured equipment. The bulk of the equipment for the project came from China. This is inclusive of the turbo-generators and balance of plant.
