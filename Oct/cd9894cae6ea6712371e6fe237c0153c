The Gwayi-Shangani Dam, one of the national projects under Zim-Asset will reach completion in the next two years. The project started in 1912 and the Zimbabwean government is keen to see its completion. The Managing director of China International Water and Electric Corporation Mr. E Shangfa said they expect to start construction of the dam wall early next year. He also pointed out financial challenges as the reason for the delay as they started work 4 years after setting up. He further added that most of the work will be done next year. Mr Shangfa promised to give monthly progress reports on the project. He said their major setback was the unavailability of foreign currency to import parts for equipment. This year alone, Mr Shangfa said, they required between US $8 and $12 m to import equipment. Additionally, the same amount was to pay the project designer, Yellow River Consultancy of China.
