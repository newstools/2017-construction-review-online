The Kenya ports Authority (KPA) has plans to construct phase II of the second container terminal at the port of Mombasa. KPA is securing US$ 339.2m loan from the Japanese government to finance the project construction. Construction work at the port is set to start in January 2018. According to KPA Managing Director Catherine Mturi-Wairi, the development tendering for the project is set to kick off soon. September 2017 is the date for the construction completion of phase I handling capacity of 550,000 TEUs.
