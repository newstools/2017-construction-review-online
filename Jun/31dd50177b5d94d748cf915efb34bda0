Enerpac recently announced the SL300 hydraulic gantry, the latest innovation in the SL series telescoping hydraulic gantries.The new entry is set to offer the highest lifting capacity on a 61cm (24-inch) track gauge in heavy lifting and rigging applications and is equipped with two stage lifting cylinders for loads up to 3000 kN.Designed to meet stringent safety requirements, the SL300 complies with the safety standards set by ASME B30.1-2015. At 2705mm retracted height, the SL300 has a lift capacity of 3000 kN (four legs).Furthermore, each gantry undergoes thorough tested to establish its limits. There is also a third-party witness test by a qualified organization. The SL300 is also CE-compliant.The SL300 Hydraulic Gantry offers industry leading features such as a wireless control system as well as integrated self-propelled drive system.According to Peter Crisci of Enerpac the SL300 is sized to fit a 61cm track gauge. He also adds aside from that, safe, reliable performance, allow their customers to satisfy their complicated lifting applications.Like all Enerpac gantries, the SL300 has self-contained hydraulics, electronic controls and Intellilift wireless control system that serve the purpose of allowing users to operate the lift locally at each leg or use an alternative remote control for unobstructed views of the load.The wireless system ensures automatic synchronization of lifting with accuracy of 25.4 mm and automatic synchronization of travel with accuracy of 15 mm.The SL300 offers a sturdy, proven base frame that can withstand a variety of environmental conditions, thereby guaranteeing durability. It can also be equipped with a powered side shift fo
