Meeting the needs of the customer is a key element of the modus operandi of Laurini Officine Meccaniche, the leading Italian company in the pipeline sector on the global market.It is what prompted the company to launch its new Vulcano XXL machine that, as its name suggests, is larger than the bestselling Vulcano 2.0, the vibrating screen on a self-propelled radio-controlled crawler that has been such a great success in the company&#8217;s history.The innovative model Vulcano XXL offers even better performance: the screening area is 30% larger than that of the Vulcano 2.0, which means higher hourly production, and in fact it can screen up to 320 cubic meters/hour under ideal conditions.Developed to respond effectively to the customers&#8217; needs relative to the type and magnitude of the project, the Vulcano XXL machine is 3.50 mt wide for shipping purposes, without dismantling, and 3 mt after removal of the crosswise conveyor belt. In addition, the discharge belt is 1000 mm wide rather than 800 mm, and the loading hopper holds 500 mm more; the underhood is also enlarged to size D5. Research and the development of new solutions in line with market needs perfectly express the sense of our corporate mission says Marco Laurini, Chairman of Laurini Officine Meccaniche. To be a leader in the sector at the global level this is exactly what we do: we develop and produce innovative customized machinery that can satisfy all demands, maintaining a unique record of excellence in our field .Vulcano XXL will not be the only new product presented by Laurini Officine Meccaniche: other projects are in the works and at the end of May the Vulcano Smart model will also be ready. This machine, designed for small and medium-sized jobs, requires no special permits for transport and can be moved from place to place at lower costs.
