The Master Builders Association of the Western Cape (MBAWC) has granted cash prizes and awards on three students studying towards qualifications in the built environment at the University of Cape Town.The awards and prizes were given to the top students in the second and third years of the Bachelor of Science (BSc) Construction Studies course, as well as to the highest achieving honours student. We believe it is important to acknowledge outstanding achievement amongst young people and hope that they will go on to carve out successful careers in the industry, said MBAWC Executive Director, Allen Bodill.Founded in 1891, MBAWCis the oldest organisation of it&#8217;s kind in South Africa. It is affiliated to M.B.S.A., the Master Builders South Africa, but is totally autonomous.The MBA&#8217;s primary objective is to ensure that the reputation of members in this area remains high and that investment in building is therefore attracted to it.It does this by insisting that Members work to the highest possible standards, aesthetically, technically and ethically &#8211; in short, that they conduct their business in a thoroughly professional manner at all times.Taking the award for top-achieving second-year student, Daniella Legland shares that she feels honoured to be recognised by an association that is so crucial to the industry in which she will work. She will be saving the prize money, saying: As a student, some extra savings will not go amiss. Apart from campaigning tirelessly for continually higher standards, the association also plays an active role in industrial relations, the drawing up and adaptation of the building contract law, safety procedures and, most importantly, training.In the last field, particularly, the MBA, Western Cape has for many years been the acknowledged leader. Some 50% of all the training done for the building industry nationwide takes place in the Western Cape &#8211; and we have a proud tradition of producing skilled and semi-skilled people who have worked on major projects all over Southern Africa.
