Directional drilling is a steerable trenchless method of installing underground pipe, conduit, or cables in a shallow arc along a prescribed bore path by using a surface-launched drilling rig, with minimal impact on the surrounding area . Taking good care of the drilling equipment is paramount for optimum efficiency. Here are some tips to help keep your directional drilling equipment in top shape for its next project:Troubleshooting tips during operation Preplanning is key in directional drilling to avoid any problems in the field. But issues can arise, and often times the cause can be plugged tooling. Look out of loss of cuttings, a spike in mud pressure or a hot reading on the beacon are some of the indicators that something is wrong in terms of the tooling being plugged off.Make sure drill operators are properly trained Staying within the drill limits, without pushing the drill too fast will help prevent pipe from coming back bent, or pipe that doesn t come back at all.Know the ground conditions It can be difficult to properly maintain equipment if it s not even well suited for the job. Selecting the right tooling and fluids for a directional bore will not only help operators complete a job successfully but also minimize the amount of wear on equipment.Rotate your drill pipe Said to be the most wearable item on a directional drill, the drill pipe should be rotated throughout the string to ensure even wearing. The pipe may not necessarily be expensive, but keeping it serviceable will determine the quality and standards of projects undertaken.Use drilling fluid Just like any other equipment, friction hastens wearing of the drill pipe, especially when used without the drilling fluids. The boring distance should not be used to determine whether one should use the drilling fluid or go ahead and work without. Moreover, drilling fluid ensures longevity in the equipment as well as completion of work in the set time limits.Use quality makeup water You may have selected the right formula of drilling fluid for the job, but if you re not careful about your water source, you may still find yourself vulnerable to potential equipment damage.
