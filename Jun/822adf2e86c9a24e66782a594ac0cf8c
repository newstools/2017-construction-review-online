The Nakambala Product Alignment and Refinery (PAAR) project at Nakambala Sugar Mill in Mazabuka, Zambia, is one of the largest projects Bosch Projects has undertaken to date.Illovo Sugar appointed Bosch Projects as engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) consultants for its subsidiary Zambia Sugar s Nakambala expansion project.This contract, which involved the expansion of the raw house production capacity and the installation of a new sugar refinery, sugar conditioning plant and packing plant, was commissioned in May 2016, on time and within budget.Also read:Bosch floor surface laser for even floors Scope of the project for Bosch Projects encompassed the design and construction of a modern, high specification refinery, required to more than double the factory s annual refined sugar production capacity, to 90 000 tons, says Steve Rosettenstein, director: sugar, Bosch Projects, part of the Bosch Holdings group of multidisciplinary engineering companies. As a result of the factory upgrade and implementation of the latest processing technologies, annual sugar production capacity at Nakambala is expected to increase from 420 000 to 450 000 tons. Bosch Projects was also awarded the contract to design and supply sugar processing equipment for the project, which was manufactured to pristine quality standards in Durban and transported by road to Zambia.State of the art processing equipment was designed in-house by the Bosch Projects team for high productivity, cost efficiency and extended service life at Nakambala.This equipment includes a continuous vacuum pan (CVP), clear juice heaters, a vacuum seed receiver, condensate flash vessels, condensers and a press water clarifier. A refinery evaporator, a 50 m high refined sugar conditioning silo and a lime and liquor wheel were also supplied.During construction of the PAAR project, over 1 200 tons of structural steel was erected, 1,6 km of piles were installed and 3 400 m of concrete was poured.Expansion of the Nakambala sugar mill and refinery has consolidated Zambia Sugar s position as Africa s single largest cane sugar producer and forms part of Illovo Sugar s strategy to focus on growth within its domestic and regional markets.This project has also boosted the development of small holder cane farmers in the area and provides employment opportunities for the local community.Bosch Projects received a CESA commendation award for the Nakambala Product Alignment and Refinery project, in the category of Best International Project . The annual CESA Excellence Awards event gives recognition for engineering excellence.Apart from sugar and ethanol engineering, Bosch Projects also offers solutions in water and waste water, energy and industrial plants, roads, land and building developments, as well as ports and terminals.
