The village now has running water; solar powered. The school has power and the school hall is now used as a community hall in the evenings. Each home has four points of light.This has been of great benefit to the Children as they can now stay up and do some studying at night. Many of the women in Wuna can now process their millet and yams at night. New jobs have been created, solar installers, maintenance, payment systems and so on.Osinbajo thinks that the Wuna home solar project is an example of how we can creatively, aggressively and successfully provide power to the people.Renewable energy probably offers us the most sustainable means of increasing energy access to those who have no electricity and have no immediate hope of being connected to the National grid.&#8221;The Minister for Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, said the ministry was committed to pursue alternative energy sources in conjunction with the private sector.The acting president also revealed that the government would embark on a broader restructuring of the electricity sector and strive to achieve a more systematic development power market design especially for the renewable energy and stressed on the need for a framework that would bring together all stakeholders towards ensuring that &#8220;renewable energy becomes a real engine of growth for the Nigerian economy.&#8221;
