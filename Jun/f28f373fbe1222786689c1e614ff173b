Thermax, India-based energy and environmental engineering solutions company has won export contracts from an undisclosed leading African company to supply four utility boilers, eight heat recovery steam generators and two flue gas steam generators to its upcoming refinery and petrochemicals project in Nigeria.The supply contract includes, manufacturing, procurement, design, engineering, testing, and supervision of the commissioning of the equipment at the site.According to MS Unnikrishnan, Thermax MD and CEO, the company has extensive experience in executing projects in Africa and is ready to execute and deliver the contract as required. The Thermax equipment comprises a 460 000 bl/d petroleum refinery and a 600 000 t/y polypropylene plant that the client is setting up in Nigeria s Lekki Free Trade Zone.This is not the first time that Thermax has been awarded a contract to supply a major African industry. In 2014, the energy and environment major received an order to supply a captive power project for one of the African conglomerate s cement plants. The scope of work included system design, manufacture, supply and supervision of erection and commissioning of the plant.The contract, valued at about $ 4.97-million was won against global competition, and is a repeat order from the client, reinforcing the confidence of African customers in Thermax s ability to provide lump-sum turnkey solutions for their power need.Unnikrishnan said that Thermax entered the project business in Africa in 2012 and had since begun gaining the trust and support of African customers for their power requirements.The power plant commissioned within 16 months will use the latest-generation atmospheric fluidised bed combustion boilers and high-pressure steam cycle to ensure optimal plant efficiency. Modern air-cooled condensers ensure low water use by the power plant.
