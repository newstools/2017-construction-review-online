A Tier IV Interim-compliant Deutz D 2011 L2i diesel engine rated at 31 hp (23 kW) powers the HR26T-9.While the Hyundai tandem-drum roller models are primarily designed for asphalt paving applications, contractors also may use these compact machines for soil compaction. The tandem-drum rollers feature front and rear scrapers to keep the drums free of material buildup. They also provide 55-gal. (208.2 L) water-spray systems that can sprinkle both the pavement surface of the drums, with operator-adjustable sprinkling intervals. Each model offers the largest drum in its weight class for optimum compaction results.Other standard equipment on Hyundai tandem-drum roller models includes ROPS roll bar, hydrostatic drive, hydrostatic vibration system at both drums, automatic vibration mode (double / single vibration), spring-loaded brakes on both drums, manual emergency stop switch with touch sensitive switch at the seat, spring-mounted driver&#8217;s compartment, four headlights, driver&#8217;s seat with armrests and safety belt, and lockable dashboard.Single-Drum Models for Soil CompactionHyundai single-drum roller models now meet Tier IV Final emissions regulations with Deutz and Cummins engines that range in horsepower from 73 to 132 (54 to 97 kW).
