As the Namibian agent, Kraatz will sell Hitachi equipment and spares as well as perform the on-site maintenance for all existing Hitachi equipment.This agency is so important to Hitachi Corporation that the company s president, Toshiaki Takase flew to Windhoek on Tuesday for a special ceremony where the deal was announced. Takase San said that Hitachi is very pleased to announce their expanding presence in the Namibian market and very excited about the future prospects and partnership with Kraatz as part of the O&amp;L Group.Hitachi Construction Machinery will focus on construction and mining machinery which consists of an extensive range of mobile units but it will also avail local mines of its Mine Management Technology systems. We are also fully committed to support Kraatz with all Marketing, Sales and Product Support functions throughout our venture and was thus keen to find a local partner that can deliver reliable solutions and optimal support to all our mining and construction clients.This venture further confirms our commitment to support our existing customers through the partnership with Kraatz [and through] a capacity building programme that would ensure local skills transfer as well as ICT solutions , said Takase San.The Kraatz Managing Director, Dirk van Niekerk, said We are very excited about this opportunity for Kraatz and are looking forward to grow this into a fully-fledged business unit that not only enhances Kraatz s offering but also ensures that Hitachi clients enjoy the benefits of services offered locally. The addition of the Hitachi agency will add 20 to 30 near-term job opportunities that can grow significantly in years to come and provides a platform for young Namibians from tertiary educational institutions to get world class on-the-job training concluded van Niekerk.
