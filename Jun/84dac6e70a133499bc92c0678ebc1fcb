The South African Institution of Mechanical Engineering (SAIMechE) is the senior body representing the discipline of mechanical engineering in South Africa. It covers all fields of application as diverse as automobile, energy generation, process engineering, heavy manufacture, design, management, research, mining and education.To apply for membership online, click hereSAIMechE is a voluntary association of Mechanical Engineers, Technologists and Technicians that have access to various grades of membership and the associated benefits.SAIMechE celebrated its centenary in 1992, marking the event with a number of valuable activities. Of particular note was the publication of the book &#8220;A century of Mechanical Engineering&#8221; copies of which can be obtained from the national office in Bruma, and the launching of the Technology Olympiad to provide early exposure to secondary school children of the world of mechanical engineering via an annual interschool competition that has now become a benchmark in effective Olympiads.The Institution publishes a magazine &#8220;The SA Mechanical Engineer&#8221; and is the host for the Research and Development Journal. Member benefits include the receipt of the magazine, the regular technical and social meetings, visits to industry and projects, access to CPD (Continuous Professional Development) courses and accredited conferences, a discount on the ECSA registration fee, and is the most effective body for networking with fellow professionals.SAIMechE liaises closely with its fellow associations to uphold and maintain the engineering profession in South Africa and participates in many representative bodies for voice to government, academia and skills development.In 2007 the Council launched a major revival initiative to embrace a higher profile in industry and society, a fully integrated administration system for all regions and branches, the identification of the modern needs of Engineers in their profession and the appointment of a full time CEO. SAIMechE is an accredited Voluntary Association by ECSA (Engineering Council of South Africa) to undertake the validation of content for CPD courses.SAIMechE is one of the founder members of the Association of Scientific and Technical Societies (AS&amp;TS), and also has links with overseas institutions, in particular, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and the British Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE). We firmly believe that SAIMechE should attract all eligible persons within mechanical engineering to become members. It is &#8220;the right thing to do&#8221;SAIMechE exists to serve the interests and needs of its members, to advance the science and practice of mechanical engineering, and to promote high standards in the profession.WHO MAY JOIN THE INSTITUTION? The answer is very simple. Any person who is involved actively, or is studying to become involved, or who is interested in mechanical engineering, or any other allied or associated field of engineering or science may apply to become a member. Applicants are graded according to their levels of education, experience and responsibility, and the annual subscriptions vary according to the grade awarded.
