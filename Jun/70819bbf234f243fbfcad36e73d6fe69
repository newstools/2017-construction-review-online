Congo Republic has officially commissioned a $109m hydroelectric dam constructed by Chinese firm Gezhouba Group. The move is aimed at enhancing the oil, agriculture and forestry sectors in the country.The 19.9 MW dam in the northern town of Liouesso, according to the government, brings Congo&#8217;s hydroelectric production to 213 MW, nearly half of total national power output. The country produced just 89 MW in 2000.Although the government is yet to find buyers for three-quarters of the dam s output, President Denis Sassou Nguesso expressed optimism in the Liouesso dam giving great productive capacity to the businesses installed in the region.Oil accounts for around 65% of GDP in the central African nation, Africa&#8217;s fourth-largest crude producer, but it is aiming to diversify its economy by increasing investments in infrastructure as well as in the mining and forestry sectors.Also read:Construction of Inga 3 hydroelectric project in DRC gets new impetusThe electricity produced is to serve households of the Ouesso city with around 4,500 inhabitants as well as its suburbs among Mkok ko.
