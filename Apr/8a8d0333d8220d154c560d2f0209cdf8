Cimerwa currently has the capacity to produce 600,000 tonnes per annum at its US$ 170m at the Rusizi plant, while Rwanda needs at least 450,000 tonnes annually. Therefore, the combined production will greatly support Rwanda s export sector and help ease cost of cement locally, said Bayigamba.She further said the plant will be put up in phases, during the phase one stage; a US$ 65m grinding unit will be put up, while the second phase will involve setting up of a fully integrated plant over a period of five years.The cement plant in Rwanda will deploy the latest cutting-edge technologies in production to help reduce greenhouse gas emission.Anders Bech, the FLSmidth cement division president also commented and said that the new plant will make Rwanda more competitive in the region and put it in a better position to promote locally-made construction materials.Prime Cement is a privately owned company that is part of the Milbridge holding a group of companies involved in the manufacturing and construction materials trade in Angola, the United Arab Emirates, Rwanda and South Africa.
