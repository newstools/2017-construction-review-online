Quality management systems in concrete construction should be the important element of the construction project. Quality management system is nothing but a set of documents that provides detailed guidelines for the quality management of concrete construction. It sets up a methodical way of establishing quality processes, functions and tasks and improving quality. Need of quality management system:Quality of concrete construction depends on many factors. From the selection of construction materials to the curing of the structural member, each and every step must be carried to maintain the quality requirement of the project. Any deviation from the required quality may result in failure of the structure or may impose penalty on the contractor for not maintaining the quality.Quality of concrete construction includes steps for maintaining the required strength of concrete within the deviation permitted and construction of a durable structure. A concrete member may have the necessary potency just after the construction, but if it not firmed well, the surface may be porous, and corrosion of reinforcement starts which reduces the lifespan of the structure. So, durability should also be an important part of the construction management system.The papers organized for quality management of concrete construction ought to have step by step procedure for all the activities to be carried out during concrete construction. The standard document should also contain testing procedures for construction materials such as cement, sand, coarse aggregates and admixtures if required. The testing procedures for concrete during construction such as workability test.The quality management system should have checklist for formwork, reinforcement, embedment, etc during construction stage.Benefits of Concrete Quality Management Systems:
