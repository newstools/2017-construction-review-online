Furthering the growth of BIM and making it easily accessible is at the core of what we do, Naidoo continues We listen to our clients and are proud to be able to offer this new flexible service as a first worldwide. We understand that clients are requiring more versatility and we have listened to this feedback. We care about the market and want to be a part of enabling local architects achieving more success and it is vital for us to show loyalty to them as they do to us .One of Graphisoft s biggest success stories has been the recent conversion on to the ARCHICAD BIM solution of the world s most successful architectural company Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) in Copenhagen Denmark.This shows that the solution is on the forefront of innovation which is needed for South African Architectural companies to make an overwhelming presentation when entering the highly competitive international markets.For more information please visit www.archicad.squarespace.comContact information.Phone: +27 31 764 1314 Email: Sales@archicad.co.za Website: www.archicad.co.zaAbout GRAPHISOFT GRAPHISOFT ignited the BIM revolution in 1984 with ARCHICAD , the industry first BIM software for architects.
