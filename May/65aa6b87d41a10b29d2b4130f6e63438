Almost 220 Tones (180 K Liter) of Admixture was used for the pour.The US$ 68m project is being built by Oscar Construction Company Limited for their Client Safari Trading Company. Mazaya Consulting Engineers are the Consultants for the project. The pouring beats the previous records of 19,793 cubic meter concrete pour held by a UAE based Construction Company.Read more about the same in the National News Paper Article below: http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/government/record-for-largest-concrete-pouring-set-in-sharjah-1.2022006
