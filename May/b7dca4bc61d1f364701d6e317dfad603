The Association of Building and Civil Engineering Contractors of Ghana (ABCECG) will launch its maiden five-year Strategic Plan at its 2017 Annual General Meeting (AGM).The two-day meeting, which opens tomorrow at the Accra International Conference Centre will be complemented with an exhibition, which aims at demonstrating the commitment of the Association towards facilitating partnerships and economic growth in the construction industry.These were contained in a statement, issued by the Association, and copied to the Ghana News Agency, on Tuesday.In a statement issued by the Association earlier on this week, Mr. Martins Kwasi Nnuro, the National President of the Association, said the Meeting would create a perfect avenue for various industry experts to share ideas to enhance their capacity so that they can handle and deliver on complex demanding projects excellently. He spoke of the recent cases of poor work quality on some projects that have exposed the lack of commitment or low capacity of the contractors involved, while necessitating the need to regulate and sanitizing the industry.He reaffirmed the commitment of the professional body to tackle unhealthy practices, saying the drive to weed out mediocrity and uphold the highest levels of professionalism possible was still gathering momentum amongst stakeholders.Consequently, he said there is a move to review all protocols governing the regulation of the construction industry in Ghana and in addition, identify existing gaps and appropriately make recommendations to address the same.More than 500 attendees will meet at the convention and exhibition to hear from a series of high profile speakers from private sector and government in an open forum and liaise with exhibitors from as far away as South Africa.Mr. Nnuro echoed this by stressing the need for very strong regional economic and social ties both within the public and the private sector, if Ghana is going to achieve significant economic growth rates.The Meeting, which would be on the theme: Promoting an Effective Construction Industry for Sustainable Development (the need for a Regulator) would, therefore, provide a platform for stakeholders to discuss issues concerning the development of Africa. This complements last year s theme and sets the tone for the establishment of a Regulator, it said. The Association recognises that construction and building of roads/infrastructure are essential to Ghana s development and growth into a first world country.
