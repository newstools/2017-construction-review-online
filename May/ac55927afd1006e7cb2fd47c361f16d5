Kigali’s City Engineer Nkurunziza Alphonse confirmed the news and said that the project will improve traffic and other conditions of the city’s central business district, employment, public transport among other things. “This road upgrade will improve the conditions of Kigali, develop public transport, enhance the employment of the citizens and eventually boost the economy of the country,” Engineer Nkurunziza said.
