According to the World Bank, almost 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa still lack access to energy, and electrification is hardly keeping pace with population growth. However, Cameroon&#8217;s drive to endorse renewable clean energy has taken another step forward.An engineer in renewable energy, Bolivie Wakam has made it his mission to teach young people in rural communities about the profits of clean energy.Also read:Power Africa initiative to invest $1.1m in Africa s energy sectorThe 29-year-old is training young people how to install solar panels.In a nation where mainstream power and electricity supply is either too expensive or out of reach, Wakam is in his hometown of Batoufam, teaching a group of students how to cleanse water using cheap solar stills.He launched his non-governmental organization, Africa Tech Solar, two years ago to support the use of clean energy.Wakam says:&#8221;This energy is sourced locally, meaning we tap into solar energy to power the panels. So what we have here is an independent system that uses a battery charged by the sun, which then powers the panels and the advantage is that the solar energy does not pollute the environment; it&#8217;s clean energy and it&#8217;s renewable.&#8221;According to the World Bank, almost 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa still lack access to energy, and electrification is hardly keeping pace with population growth.So far Africa Tech Solar has installed solar powered street lights, multimedia installations and a water purification plant in Batoufam.People are now using computers and Wakam&#8217;s students are inspired by the idea of clean, renewable energy.Analysts say Africa&#8217;s energy sector needs investment of approximately 55 billion US dollars per year until 2030 to make up power shortage and offer everyone with access to electricity.Last year World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved an International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan of $325 million to strengthen Cameroon s national electricity transmission network.
