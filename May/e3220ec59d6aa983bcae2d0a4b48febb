In my understanding, too many contractors refuse to let go of their way of doing things notwithstanding of the cost to themselves and their business. They don&#8217;t want to be jumbled with new ideas.You may possibly be successively running your business appropriately and making revenue, but with just a little fine-tuning of your &#8220;tried and true ways&#8221;, you could be making more earnings, with less effort. Why not take a look?This is a critical factor, but so hard for many to accept. It is difficult to let employees go, but if you don&#8217;t have a positive cash flow, eventually the whole business will go under.
