14 units sold for use in Botswana communications infrastructure redT energy plc (AIM:RED), the energy storage technology company, announces the sale of fourteen units into sub-Saharan Africa, a key growth market for the Company. Fourteen of redT’s 40kWh modules have been purchased by the Botswana-based customer, who will use the machines to provide energy security at critical communications infrastructure sites across the country. All fourteen sites are in remote locations with no grid connection and will use 11kWp of solar panels per site as the sole form of generation. redT’s units will be used to store a proportion of the solar energy generated during daylight hours for use during the evening. This process is known as ‘timeshifting’ and effectively creates ‘firm’ 24h solar power, which is cheaper per kWh of energy than running a diesel generator off-grid. “redT’s technology was chosen for the project owing to the machines’ long service life, low maintenance requirements and the product’s ability to operate at challenging sites such as these, where conventional lead-acid and lithium batteries have been used before and have experienced critical failure.,” said Scott McGregor, CEO, redT energy redT’s technology was chosen for the project owing to the machines’ long service life, low maintenance requirements and the product’s ability to operate at challenging sites such as these, where conventional lead-acid and lithium batteries have been used before and have experienced critical failure. redT, which has an office in South Africa, has already deployed a number of units in sub-Saharan Africa and views the  region as a key future growth market for their products. redT, which has an office in South Africa, has already deployed a number of units in sub-Saharan Africa and views the  region as a key future growth market for their products.
